## Chat Client  
September 2017 – June 2018
[Repo](https://github.com/czeng18/InternetChat_v2.0)
A chat client with basic key agreement and encryption.
I built this as a fun project during my junior and senior years of high school 
as an exercise to learn about networking, concurrency, and encryption.  The main 
features of the project are the usage of Java sockets to host and connect to 
chat rooms hosted by different computers, the implementation of Diffie-Hellman key agreement 
that (mostly) works, and the symmetric block cipher for message encryption and decryption.
